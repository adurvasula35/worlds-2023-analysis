FIRST Tech Challenge: OPR vs. Final Rank Analysis  

This project analyzes data from the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) World Championships to determine the correlation between a team's Offensive Power Rating (OPR) and their final placement. It introduces a new metric, "Average Adjusted OPR," which accounts for the strength of a team's partners and opponents in each match. The primary goal is to assess how well this adjusted OPR predicts a team's final rank.
