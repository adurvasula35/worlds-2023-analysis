FIRST Robotics Competition: OPR vs. Final Rank Analysis
This project analyzes data from a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) event to determine the correlation between a team's Offensive Power Rating (OPR) and their final placement. It introduces a new metric, "Average Adjusted OPR," which accounts for the strength of a team's partners and opponents in each match. The primary goal is to assess how well this adjusted OPR predicts a team's final rank.
